# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview
Whose Turn Is It Anyway?

    My idea is a simple.  Many of us have shared tasks in our lives.  Tasks we share with other individuals:  load the dishwasher, 
take out the trash, dive the carpool, etcetera.  My software will keep track of whose turn it is to perform a particular task. 
A primary user will create an account, create a job--a task that can be shared with other users such as "Do the Dishes", and allow 
that job to be shared with secondary users of the primary user's choosing.  When one user has done the dishes that user logs in
and indicates to the software that their turn is complete. The software will then notify the next user in line that they will
need to wash the next pile of dishes.
    I am a father of 3. I've found that it is easy to lose track of whose turn it is to perform a shared task. Further, the children
are absolutely no help in this regard.  I've looked many times online and have found no software whose primary features include
this functionality.  If these features are found within some other software--like a calendar--the marketers of that software haven't
done a good job highlighting those features because I haven't found them either. 
    I have almost no experience in office settings.  But I imagine that there are shared tasks in that environment. Perhaps 
the office purchasing agent simply cannot buy good coffee for the break room.  A team leader has taken upon herself to fix this
and has assembled a volunteer team who will purchase and donate quality coffee for the office.  My software will keep track of whose
turn it is to buy that coffee.  As you can see this is purely speculative.  I assume a plethora of shared tasks in a multitude of
work evirons exist. If I'm correct, then perhaps there are tasks no one wants to perform--which explains why it is shared.  If no
one wants to perform the task then informing the next person that it is their turn may be an uncomfortable thing to do.  With this
software a person will not need to be "the bad guy". If not, at least I know moms and dads will find this very useful.
